# Heimdall Alerts/Alarms Panel

It's wrote in Elixir and uses Phoenix Framework to show the Panel. The system is compatible with Nagios but with another approach. The mission of Heimdall is access to all of the server he has to review, run the scripts and gather all the information to show alarms in the Panel and trigger alerts.

You can see what is done and what is in progress in our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/YhO5JVG1/heimdall) board.

More information coming soon.
